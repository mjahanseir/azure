# Lab 01 - Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities

## Lab introduction

This is the first in a series of labs for Azure Administrators. In this lab, you learn about users and groups. Users and groups are the basic building blocks for an identity solution. 

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Lab scenario

Your organization is building a new lab environment for pre-production testing of apps and services.  A few engineers are being hired to manage the lab environment, including the virtual machines. To allow the engineers to authenticate by using Microsoft Entra ID, you have been tasked with provisioning users and group. To minimize administrative overhead, membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on job titles. 

## Lab - Interactive lab simulation

This lab uses an interactive lab simulation. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. An Azure subscription is not required. 

>**Note:** This simulation is being updated. Microsoft Entra ID is the new name for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
